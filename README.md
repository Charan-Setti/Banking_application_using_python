# Banking_application_using_python

 This Python script is a simple banking application that allows users to register, login, and reset their password. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and validate user information. 

- The `Reg` class contains methods for user registration, login, and password reset.
- During registration, users are prompted to input their personal details such as first name, last name, email, phone number, username, and password. Email format and password strength are validated before storing the data in the database.
- The login method checks the provided username and password against the database records to grant access.
- The password reset functionality allows users to update their password by verifying their username first.
- The main program runs a loop where users can choose from registration, login, password reset, or exit options.

This code demonstrates basic user authentication and data manipulation functionalities for a banking application. It can be further enhanced by adding more features like transaction history, account management, and security enhancements.
